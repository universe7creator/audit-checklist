# audit-checklist

Executable smart contract audit checklist — drop-in Foundry test templates for common vulnerability classes. By [kcolbchain](https://kcolbchain.com) (est. 2015).

## Why this exists

Most audit checklists are PDFs. This one is code. Import it into your Foundry project and run `forge test` — it checks for reentrancy, access control gaps, oracle manipulation, upgrade risks, and flash loan vectors against your contracts.

Based on patterns from real audits since 2019.

## Quick start

```bash
forge install kcolbchain/audit-checklist
```

```solidity
import {ReentrancyCheck} from "audit-checklist/checks/ReentrancyCheck.sol";

contract MyVaultAudit is ReentrancyCheck {
    function setUp() public {
        targetContract = address(new MyVault());
    }
}
```

```bash
forge test
```

## Vulnerability classes covered

| Check | What it detects |
|-------|----------------|
| `ReentrancyCheck` | Checks-effects-interactions violations, cross-function reentrancy via callbacks |
| `AccessControlCheck` | Unprotected admin functions, unguarded initializers, missing role checks |
| `OracleCheck` | Spot price reads (manipulable), missing TWAP, single-source oracles |
| `UpgradeCheck` | Storage layout collisions in proxies, uninitialized implementation contracts |
| `FlashLoanCheck` | Functions vulnerable to flash-loan-powered price/state manipulation |
